# NumPy Overview

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

## üîπ Key Features of NumPy

- **N-Dimensional Arrays**  
  NumPy provides the powerful `ndarray` object for fast and flexible n-dimensional array operations.

- **Mathematical Operations**  
  It includes a wide range of mathematical operations such as element-wise addition, multiplication, dot products, statistical operations, and more.

- **Broadcasting**  
  Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes in a memory-efficient way.

- **Linear Algebra and FFT**  
  NumPy includes modules for linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and even random number generation.

- **Integration with Other Libraries**  
  Libraries like Pandas, SciPy, and Scikit-learn are built on top of NumPy arrays.

- **Performance**  
  NumPy is implemented in C and optimized for performance. Operations on arrays are vectorized, making them much faster than native Python loops.
